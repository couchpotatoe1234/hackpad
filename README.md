# hackpad
A simple 4x4 macropad for my 3d designing on Onshape.
You can use this for the various tools in Onshape (sketch, extrude etc.) or you can change the keybinds to your own liking.
I designed this to improve my life using Onshape, not having to press all the keyboard shortcuts individually but having them all on one board.
